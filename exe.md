To provide the most detailed summary possible, let's go through each PDF document comprehensively, covering all key concepts, diagrams, formulas, and explanations.

### PDF 1: Introduction to PCM (Pulse Code Modulation)
#### Overview:
Pulse Code Modulation (PCM) is a technique used to digitally represent analog signals. It is commonly used in audio recording, telephony, and digital communications. PCM involves three main processes: sampling, quantization, and encoding.

#### Detailed Explanation:
1. *Sampling*:
   - *Definition*: Sampling is the process of taking periodic measurements of an analog signal.
   - *Nyquist Theorem*: To accurately reconstruct the original signal, the sampling rate must be at least twice the highest frequency present in the signal (Nyquist rate).
     \[
     f_s \geq 2f_m
     \]
     Where \( f_s \) is the sampling rate, and \( f_m \) is the maximum frequency of the analog signal.
   - *Aliasing*: If the sampling rate is below the Nyquist rate, aliasing occurs, causing different signals to become indistinguishable.

2. *Quantization*:
   - *Definition*: Quantization is the process of mapping the sampled amplitude values to discrete levels.
   - *Quantization Levels*: The number of levels (L) is typically a power of 2 (e.g., 256 levels for 8-bit quantization).
   - *Quantization Step Size (\(\Delta\))*: The difference between adjacent quantization levels.
     \[
     \Delta = \frac{V_{max} - V_{min}}{L}
     \]
     Where \( V_{max} \) and \( V_{min} \) are the maximum and minimum values of the analog signal.
   - *Quantization Error*: The difference between the actual analog value and the quantized value, leading to quantization noise.
     \[
     Q = x - \hat{x}
     \]
     Where \( x \) is the actual sample value, and \( \hat{x} \) is the quantized value.

3. *Encoding*:
   - *Definition*: Encoding converts the quantized values into a binary form.
   - *Binary Representation*: Each quantized level is represented by a binary code. For instance, with 8-bit encoding, there are 256 possible binary codes.
   - *Bit Rate (R_b)*: The rate at which bits are transmitted.
     \[
     R_b = v \cdot f_s
     \]
     Where \( v \) is the number of bits per sample, and \( f_s \) is the sampling rate.

4. *Signal-to-Quantization Noise Ratio (SQNR)*:
   - *Definition*: A measure of the quality of the quantized signal.
   - *Formula*:
     \[
     \text{SQNR} = \frac{P_s}{P_q}
     \]
     Where \( P_s \) is the power of the signal, and \( P_q \) is the power of the quantization noise.
   - *Expressed in Decibels (dB)*:
     \[
     \text{SQNR (dB)} = 6.02v + 1.76
     \]
     Where \( v \) is the number of bits per sample.

### PDF 2: Analog Modulation Systems
#### Overview:
Analog modulation is a technique used to transmit information by varying a carrier wave. The main types of analog modulation are Amplitude Modulation (AM), Frequency Modulation (FM), and Phase Modulation (PM).

#### Detailed Explanation:
1. *Amplitude Modulation (AM)*:
   - *Definition*: The amplitude of the carrier wave is varied in proportion to the message signal.
   - *Equation*:
     \[
     s(t) = [A + m(t)] \cos(2 \pi f_c t)
     \]
     Where \( s(t) \) is the modulated signal, \( A \) is the carrier amplitude, \( m(t) \) is the message signal, and \( f_c \) is the carrier frequency.
   - *Modulation Index (\(\mu\))*: The ratio of the maximum amplitude of the message signal to the carrier amplitude.
     \[
     \mu = \frac{A_m}{A_c}
     \]
     Where \( A_m \) is the maximum amplitude of the message signal, and \( A_c \) is the carrier amplitude.

2. *Frequency Modulation (FM)*:
   - *Definition*: The frequency of the carrier wave is varied in accordance with the message signal.
   - *Equation*:
     \[
     s(t) = A \cos \left[2 \pi f_c t + 2 \pi k_f \int_0^t m(\tau) d\tau \right]
     \]
     Where \( k_f \) is the frequency sensitivity.
   - *Frequency Deviation (\(\Delta f\))*: The maximum shift from the carrier frequency.
     \[
     \Delta f = k_f \cdot A_m
     \]
     Where \( A_m \) is the maximum amplitude of the message signal.

3. *Phase Modulation (PM)*:
   - *Definition*: The phase of the carrier wave is varied in proportion to the message signal.
   - *Equation*:
     \[
     s(t) = A \cos \left[2 \pi f_c t + k_p m(t) \right]
     \]
     Where \( k_p \) is the phase sensitivity.

4. *Advantages and Disadvantages*:
   - *AM*: Simple to implement, but susceptible to noise and requires more power.
   - *FM*: Better noise immunity and efficiency, but requires more bandwidth.
   - *PM*: Good noise immunity, but more complex demodulation.

#### Overview:
Line coding is the process of converting binary data into a digital signal suitable for transmission over a physical medium. Different line coding schemes have different properties that make them suitable for various applications.

#### Detailed Explanation:
1. *Unipolar NRZ (Non-Return to Zero)*:
   - *Definition*: Uses a single voltage level to represent binary data.
   - *Example*: 0 is 0V, and 1 is +V.

2. *Polar NRZ*:
   - *Definition*: Uses two voltage levels, positive and negative.
   - *Example*: 0 is -V, and 1 is +V.

3. *Manchester Encoding*:
   - *Definition*: Combines the clock and data signals by encoding each bit as a transition.
   - *Encoding Scheme*:
     \[
     \begin{cases}
     0 \rightarrow \text{High to Low transition} \\
     1 \rightarrow \text{Low to High transition}
     \end{cases}
     \]

4. *Bipolar AMI (Alternate Mark Inversion)*:
   - *Definition*: Represents binary 1s by alternating positive and negative voltages, and binary 0s by 0V.
   - *Advantage*: Reduces DC component and allows error detection.

5. *HDB3 (High-Density Bipolar-3)*:
   - *Definition*: A version of bipolar encoding used in E1 systems to ensure synchronization.
   - *Encoding Rules*:
     - Substitutes sequences of four consecutive zeros with "000V" or "B00V" to maintain synchronization.
     - \( V \) indicates a violation bit, and \( B \) indicates a balancing bit.

6. *Power Spectral Density (PSD)*:
   - *Definition*: A measure of the signal's power distribution over frequency.
   - *Calculation*: The autocorrelation function of the signal is used to derive the PSD.
   - *Formula*:
     \[
     S(f) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} R(\tau) e^{-j 2 \pi f \tau} d\tau
     \]
     Where \( R(\tau) \) is the autocorrelation function.
